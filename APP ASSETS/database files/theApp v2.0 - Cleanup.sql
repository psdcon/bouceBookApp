Getting into and out of the tucked shape is one of the fundamental body movements of trampoline gymnastics. The others basic shapes are: straight(link), piked(link), and straddled pike(link). When you get comfortable with making your tucked shape at the top of your bounce our coaches will start asking you to "line out".

The best way to describe a good tuck jump/line out is "explosive". Get into the shape fast, get out of the shape fast. There is no requirement to display the shape for as long as possible. In fact, this is undesireable. The technical description of the tucked shape cn be found in the FIG code of points 2013-2016 section 14.6.3. It says that "The angle between the upper body and thighs must be equal to or less than 135 degrees and the angle between the thighs and lower legs must be equal to or less than 135 degrees."

Making the piked shape is one of the fundamental body movements of trampoline gymnastics. The others basic shapes are: straight(link), tucked(link), and straddled pike(link). When you get comfortable with making your piked shape at the top of your bounce our coaches will start asking you to "line out". This involves pushing back to the straight shape as soon as you''ve displayed your perfect pin-point precise pike. Your arms should reamin in line with your body. Many gymnasts find it helps to imagine yourself putting on trousers to start learning to line-out. See the video for this skill if you find that difficult to imagine. The best way to describe a good pike jump/line out is "snappy". Get into the shape fast, get out of the shape fast. There is no requirement to display the shape for as long as possible. In face, this is undesireable. The technical description of the piked shape can be found in the FIG code of points 2013-2016 section 14.6.2. It says that "The angle between the upper body and thighs must be equal to or less than 135 degrees and the angle between the thighs and lower legs must be greater than 135 degrees." The 2013-2016 code of points has no requirement to touch the legs during a pike jump. Many coaches will still encourage a gymnast to do so, though. A good rule of thumb is that if you''re not telling your arms what to do, they''re proabably doing something wrong. Touching your toes (or at least trying to) ensures taht your arms are kept "straight and/or held close to the body" as FIG requiers. Some judges may not be aware of the omission in the new code, too.

A big confident straight bounce displaying a straddled pike (usually just called a "straddle") shape at the top of the bounce. Useful for beginners to get used to how it feels to move the body during a bounce, useful for more skilled competitors to demonstrate their body control, core strength and flexibility. See the body prep. section, or ask acoach at training for ways to improve your straddle shape! Making the straddle shape is one of the fundamental body movements of trampoline gymnastics. The others basic shapes are: straight(link), tucked(link), and piked(link). Out of all of these shapes, straddled is the only one which cannot be used during a somersault in competition. Experianced tramps will sometimes do straddled somersaults during training. These are purely for fun, and cannot be used in a routine.
