Many gymnasts find it helps to imagine yourself putting on trousers to start learning to line-out. See the video for this skill if you find that difficult to imagine. The best way to describe a good straddle jump/line out is "confident". Get into the shape fast, get out of the shape fast. There is no requirement to display the shape for as long as possible. In face, this is undesireable. The technical description of the straddle shape is the same for that of a piked jump except that the legs should be spread apart. Preferably at a 90 degree angle. The technical definition of the piked shape can be found in the FIG code of points 2013-2016 section 14.6.2. It says that "The angle between the upper body and thighs must be equal to or less than 135 degrees and the angle between the thighs and lower legs must be greater than 135 degrees." The 2013-2016 code of points has no requirement to touch the legs during a straddle jump. Many coaches will still encourage a gymnast to do so, though. A good rule of thumb is that if you''re not telling your arms what to do, they''re proabably doing something wrong. Some judges may not be aware of the omission in the new code, too. Touching your toes ensures that the arms are kept "straight and/or held close to the body" as FIG requires.  Long story short: reach for your toes, it''s pretty! ', 'Take off like a straight jump. Get in and out of the shape rapidly once you''re at the top of your bounce. Straight arms. Reach for your toes during. Pulling on your trousers. Pointed toes. Reach for your toes.\nMake sure your legs come IN FRONT of you, otherwise it''s a star jump!', 'null', 'null', '["Seat Drop"]', 'Show the difference to a star jump'),
